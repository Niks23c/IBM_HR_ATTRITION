## Create Storage (Blob) & containers
creating an Azure Storage account (Blob, Data Lake, etc.), Microsoft gives us options to protect our data against failures.
One of those options is Redundancy.

### ðŸ‘‰ LRS = Locally Redundant Storage

It keeps 3 copies of our data, within a single datacenter (inside one Azure region).

This protects against hardware failures (like if a disk/server goes bad).

It is the cheapest redundancy option.

BUT â€” if the entire datacenter goes down (like fire, flood, or power outage), us could lose access to cpmpanay's data.

Other redundancy options include:

ZRS (Zone Redundant Storage): Copies across 3 availability zones in one region (safer).

GRS (Geo-Redundant Storage): Copies to a paired region (hundreds of kilometers away).

RA-GRS (Read-Access GRS): Same as GRS, but also gives read-only access to the secondary region.

### ðŸ“Œ For our IBM HR project, since weâ€™re just learning and experimenting, using LRS is fine (cheapest and enough for non-production).
In a real company project, theyâ€™d likely choose ZRS or GRS depending on business needs.
